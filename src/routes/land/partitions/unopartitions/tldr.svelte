			I'm Gururam, and my passion for technology and programming ignited when I was just 11,
			captivated by Linux and the magic of writing my first lines of Python code. That spark grew
			into a fascination with the power of technology, leading me deeper into networking during
			secondary school. I spent hours unraveling the complexities of network protocols with tools
			like Wireshark and Nmap, feeling like I was deciphering a hidden language of the digital
			world. My professional journey as an Infrastructure Engineer provided invaluable real-world
			experience, allowing me to hone my skills further and expand my knowledge through
			certification preparations like CompTIA A+ and Network+. Each project and challenge was a
			chance to learn and grow. Today, I'm more driven than ever to make a real-world impact with
			technology. I'm excited by the constantly evolving digital landscape and embrace every
			obstacle as an opportunity to learn and find creative solutions. For me, it's not just about
			the code; it's about the positive impact we can have on the world. I believe in the power of
			technology to connect, educate, and build a better future. I'm excited to explore new
			technologies, collaborate with others who share my passion, and continue writing the story of
			my life, one line of code at a time.
